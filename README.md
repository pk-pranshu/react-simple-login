# Project Title

Simple React Redux app

## Description

A simple app that uses React, Redux and React-router to create an login page. Please use the following credentials: -  
`username: macintosh@xyz.com`  
`password: mojave`on the login page. On a successful login it should take you to the home page.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* NodeJS

### Instructions to run the App

* clone the repository
* cd into react-simple-login folder
* run `npm install`
* run `npm start`
* open http://localhost:8080/

Please use the following credentials: -  
`username: macintosh@xyz.com`  
`password: mojave`

## Design Decisions

* The login page is very simple. It contains a form component that matches the username and password.
* The verification method does not let submit an empty form nor does it work for other credentials.
* Warns the user if the above conditions are not met.
* can add a Remember me and forgot password option to the page. Currently it is not there.
